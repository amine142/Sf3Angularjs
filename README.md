## CRUD API with Symfony 3 and FOSRESTBundle

This is a basic CRUD API using Symfony 3 and FOSRESTBundle.

The aim was to learn how to use Symfony 3 (along with some other bundles) to quickly make a working
RESTful API to use as the back end for any modern front-end framework - such as Angular, React, Ember, or any of the mobile app frameworks like Ionic, or desktop frameworks such as Electron.

The code you see here is providing the same functionality as the one created with Twig, but you will need a REST client such as Postman to interact properly with the API.
