## CRUD with Angular 1.5, Symfony 3, FOSRESTBundle

This is basic CRUD API using Angular 1.5 to talk to Symfony 3 and FOSRESTBundle.

This is the Angular code to talk to the API made in the [repository][1].

The aim was to learn how to use Symfony 3 (along with some other bundles) to quickly make a working RESTful API to use as the back end for any modern front-end framework - such as Angular, React, Ember, or any of the mobile app frameworks like Ionic, or desktop frameworks such as Electron.

This project was based on the [Angular Seed][2] app.

### PHP 7

This app was written using PHP 7.
